<h2>The Idea of Routing</h2>

<p>
Usually if you mess with the URL of the page you’re on with Javascript, the browser is going to 
make a request for the new page.

<p>
The URL is available as <code>window.location</code>. You can set it, if you want, to any URL, 
like:

<pre>
<code>
window.location = 'http://mozilla.org';
</code>
</pre>

<p>Go ahead and paste that into your console, press enter, and you’ll see that you end up at <a title="Home of the Mozilla Project — Mozilla" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">mozilla.org</a>. We’ll be here when you back button.

<p>
Welcome back. So we’ve seen that changing the URL can be accomplished by Javascript. But of course, when you go to that new page, 
Javascript “starts over.” So if you do this: 

<pre>
<code>
var important = "something important";
window.location = 'http://mozilla.org';
</code>
</pre>

<p>
When you get to <code>http://mozilla.org</code>, the variable <code>important</code> is gone, never to be seen again. This is kind of 
a bummer, because if you’re writing an application with Javascript (as opposed to just a plain, static HTML page), then you might
want to be able to use URLs as a sort of “navigation” technique. Suppose, for example, you’re writing a simple <code>Lexicon</code>
for linguistics. Let’s imagine that this is an incredibly dumb <code>Lexicon</code>, and it’s modeled by nothing more than an 
array of three strings: 

<script class=example>
var lexicon = ['casa', 'piedra', 'calle'];
</script>

<p>
Fancy right? Now, we could write some Javascript to search this:

<script class=example>
var search = function(query){
  return lexicon.filter(function(word){
    return word === query
  })
}
</script>

<p>
Of course, we're going to want a little bit of infrastructure to run this search function for the user. I’ll just use an <code>input</code>
and a <code>ul</code>:

<script class=example>

</script>









<script>

</script>
</body>
